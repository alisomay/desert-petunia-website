        Desert Petunia is a project dedicated to keep the spirit of the first
        interactions I've had with music through computers back in early 90's.
        <br />
        <br />
        Light, playful, curious, setting the mood for emergent natural fun.
        <br />
        <br />
        Dedicated to preserve the "beginner's mind".
        <br />
        <br />
        The name of "Petunia" which is in the domain inspired from young Pete's
        tattoo is thought as the name of my current and future projects.
        <br />
        Though there is currently one, there might be more in the future.
